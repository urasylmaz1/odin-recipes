    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ground beef (80/20 blend recommended)</li>
        <li>hamburger buns</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>cheese slices (optional)</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>tomato slices</li>
        <li>onion slices</li>
        <li>pickles</li>
        <li>ketchup</li>
        <li>mustard</li>
        <li>mayonnaise (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Avoid overworking the meat.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties, making a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill or skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness. Adjust cooking time for desired doneness.</li>
        <li>If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking,  toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Assemble the hamburger by placing the cooked patty on the bottom half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Add desired toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your choice of sides, such as fries or a salad.</li>
    </ol>
